faq:
  - q: Is there an official Airbnb API?
    a: >-
      No public API. Airbnb partners with select property management systems.
      Hosts can use Airbnb's own tools for managing properties.
  - q: Can I integrate with property management software?
    a: >-
      Yes, through Airbnb's official property management partnerships (e.g.,
      Guesty, Hostaway, Lodgify).
  - q: What about getting listing data?
    a: >-
      No official way to get public listing data programmatically. Scraping
      violates Airbnb's terms of service.

      Yes - Booking.com, VRBO, and other platforms offer APIs for property
      managers and channel managers.
